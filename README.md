  # React Portfolio

  ## Deployed Site
  https://samuelheal.github.io/React-Portfolio/
  
  ## Description:
  The task was to create a portfolio page using React.js. The portfolio was required to have multiple pages that were switched using the navigation bar with the 'about' section being open by default on load. The projects needed to use a single component that would get repeated for each project added. Finally, the form needed to advise on whether the email entered is valid or not (please note the form is actually working currently).
